# PhishGuard Project

A comprehensive Anti-Phishing System consisting of a Browser Extension and a Reporting Dashboard.
Academic Project Submission.

## 📂 Project Structure

- `extension/` - Chrome/Edge/Brave Extension source code.
  - `manifest.json` - V3 Manifest
  - `popup/` - Extension UI
  - `scripts/` - Background and Content scripts for detection
- `website/` - PhishGuard Hub (Web Platform)
  - `dashboard.html` - Import & View Reports
  - `learn.html` - Educational content

## 🚀 Installation & Usage

### 1. PhishGuard Extension (Chrome/Edge/Brave)
1. Open your browser and go to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Enable **Developer Mode** (top right toggle).
3. Click **Load unpacked**.
4. Select the `extension/` folder from this project.
5. The PhishGuard icon should appear in your toolbar.

**How to use:**
- Visit any website.
- The extension automatically scans the page.
- Click the icon to see the Security Score and Status.
- Click "Scan Now" to force a re-scan.
- Click "Export Reports" to download the `.json` log file.

### 2. PhishGuard Hub (Website)
1. This project is hosted on Replit.
2. The website serves the `website/` directory content.
3. Open the Dashboard.
4. Click **Import Extension JSON** and upload the file you exported from the extension.
5. View detailed analytics and export to PDF.

## 🛡️ Detection Logic (Simulated)

For academic purposes, detection features are simulated as follows:
- **HTTPS Check**: Real check of `window.location.protocol`.
- **Password Input**: Real DOM check for `input[type="password"]`.
- **New Domain**: Simulated. Domains ending in `.xyz` or containing `test` are treated as < 30 days old.
- **PhishTank**: Simulated. URLs containing `login`, `secure`, `account` on non-standard domains are flagged.

## ⚠️ Limitations
- **Simulated Databases**: WHOIS and PhishTank APIs are mocked as per project constraints ("No paid APIs").
- **Offline Mode**: Designed to work without backend servers.
- **Persistence**: Extension uses `chrome.storage.sync` (limited capacity).

## 🔮 Future Enhancements
- Integration with Real WHOIS API.
- Machine Learning model for URL pattern analysis.
- Community-driven reporting system.
